1. Differentiate between C &amp; C++. Discuss OOP features.

C :
-> C is a structured language 
-> focuses on procedures and fuctions
-> data and behaviour are typically separate 
-> limited support for data hiding and abstraction 
-> ex- c , pascal , etc . 

C++ :
-> C++ is a object oriented language 
-> focuses on classes and objects 
-> incapsulates data and behaviour within objects 
-> supports data and behaviour within objects 
-> ex - C++ , Java , Python etc
